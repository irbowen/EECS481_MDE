### Order of attack
1. Fine-tuning of fabric and depth detection    - BY 11/25
2. Figuring out bounds for success/failure      - BY 11/25
3. How long it takes to "lock in" a circle      - BY 11/25
4. Calibration/Responsiveness                   - initial_buffer[] DONE / Cursor Responsiveness BY 11/26
5. Expansion rate for objects on screen         - Easily Adjusted by changing GameIncreaseFactor in GAME.h or GAME.cpp
6. For target game: Format and direction of game  - ENOUGH DONE FOR BETA, "round variable"
7. Pretty graphics for target game              - ENOUGH DONE FOR BETA
8. Good sounds for target game                  - BY 11/24
9. For kinect-the-dots (ktd) game, detecting continuous depth + motion    - NOT FOR BETA
10. For ktd, animation of line
11. Generating patterns for ktd
13. Graphics for ktd
14. Sounds for ktd
15. Making the beta presentable
16. User interface to modify game. (sudo)
